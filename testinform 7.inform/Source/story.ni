The hospital room is a room. 
The description of the hospital room is“ You see your sister laying on her bed. She looks weak and pale. You ask her:’Hello little sister, how are you?’ She does not respond. After a little while of silence she starts speaking under one´s breath:’Hey brother, i am a little bit tired, however, I am doing fine!’ ‚But can I beg you for something?‘ You:’Yeah, of course, everything you want!’ 
‚I did not have for a long time chocolate…I would like to eat chocolate again!‘ ‚That would make me happy!‘ ‚Could you find some chocolate for me?‘
You get excited and want to start right now searching for chocolate. ‚Yeah! I will find chocolate for you, the best chocolate of the town!‘ 
You go back into the center.
